## What is it?
This is project to reimplement classic Warcraft gameplay using Unreal Engine 5.

## What is the goal of the project?

The main goal is revive good old RTS genre.

To achive that, I highlight three subgoals of the project.

### Run scirmish map

First and most easy subgoal is run into Unreal Engine melee scirmish maps. To do this, I need reinvent Warcraft gameplay algorithms, rebuild UI and import Warcraft assets into Unreal

### Run campaign

Second goal is run entire Warcraft campaigns in Unreal. To do this, I need to add even more abilities to my project, for example, run JASS script or cinematic created inside Warcraft engine.

### Recreate WorldEditor

And third, and most ambitious subgoal is create Unreal Plugin thats rebuild and expand function of WorldEditor.

### About WorldEditor

WorldEditor was a tool to create custom Warcraft III maps, and for this times it was extreamly powerful and handy. WorldEditor united entire Warcraft modding community, that still exists and create new content every day.

WorldEditor's main merit was that it open doors to gameplay for many peoples, and help to invent entire new game genres. For example, Tower Defence genre and famous game Dota was invented in WorldEditor

### Why this important?

First at all, remake Openwarcft is highly anticipated by the gamer community,  judging by their reaction to Warcraft Reforged.

Then, WorldEditor bring the power of Unreal merged with Warcraft III asset base to any gamer. Classic WorldEditor offer hundreds of high-quality animated 3d models, sounds, effects, and allow everyone tell them story. With WorldEditor builded upon Unreal Engine, everyone receive even more. The ability to build simple RTS and RPG games fast and easy.

Even more impotant that Warcraft have ability load models in runtime from map file. So, its opened endless possibility to developers, allow load any model or effect without baking it in remake, on runtime.
