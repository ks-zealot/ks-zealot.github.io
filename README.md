## What is it?
This is a project to reimplement classic Warcraft gameplay using Unreal Engine 5.

## What is the goal of the project?

 To achieve this, I decided to make a remake of Warcraft.
Firstly, a remake of Warcraft on modern technologies is urgently needed by the gaming community, this can be seen from its reaction to Warcraft Reforged.

Secondly, when buying Warcraft, people bought WorldEditor, an extremely powerful and flexible tool, allowing you to use hundreds of high-quality models that come with Warcraft, make your own maps, campaigns, and even invent your own genres.

For example, the genres of Tower Defense and even the famous Dota were invented in WorldEditor. It was WorldEditor that opened the way to gamedev for many hundreds of people.

In this way, I can offer both a classic RTS experience and the ability to tell my own stories using the Warcraft assets along with Unreal technologies.

## Key stages of the project

### Single map

The first stage, launches a single Warcraft map. To do this, I need to make an RTS UI, simple AI and import Warcraft resources into Unreal.

### Campaign

Launch the entire Warcraft campaign. To do this, in addition to the previous functionality, add the ability to play videos on the engine and execute Jass scripts.

### WorldEditor

The final goal of this project is to recreate WorldEditor as a plugin for UnrealEngine that will be available on the marketplace.
