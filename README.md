## What is it?
This is a project to reimplement classic Warcraft gameplay using Unreal Engine 5.

## What is the goal of the project?

The main goal is to revive the good old RTS genre.

To achieve that, I highlight three subgoals of the project.

### Run skirmish map

First and most easy subgoal is to run into Unreal Engine melee skirmish maps. To do this, I need reinvent Warcraft gameplay algorithms, rebuild UI and import Warcraft assets into Unreal

### Run campaign

Second goal is to run entire Warcraft campaigns in Unreal. To do this, I need to add even more abilities to my project, for example, run JASS script or cinematic created inside Warcraft engine.

### Recreate WorldEditor

And third, and most ambitious subgoal is create Unreal Plugin thats rebuild and expand function of WorldEditor.

### About WorldEditor

WorldEditor was a tool to create custom Warcraft III maps, and for this time it was extremely powerful and handy. WorldEditor united the entire Warcraft modding community that still exists and created new content every day.

WorldEditor's main merit was that it opened doors to gameplay for many peoples, and helped to invent entire new game genres. For example, Tower Defence genre and famous game Dota was invented in WorldEditor

### Why is this important?

First of all, the remake of Warcraft is highly anticipated by the gamer community, Â judging by their reaction to Warcraft Reforged.

Then, WorldEditor brings the power of Unreal merged with Warcraft III asset base to any gamer. Classic WorldEditor offers hundreds of high-quality animated 3d models, sounds, effects, and allows everyone to tell their story. With WorldEditor builded upon Unreal Engine, everyone receives even more. The ability to build simple RTS and RPG games fast and easy.

Even more important that Warcraft has the ability to load models at runtime from map files. So, it opened endless possibilities to developers, allowing them to load any model or effect without baking it in remake, on runtime.


## What work now?

- Parsing mdx models
- Runtime loading skeletal mesh with animation from mdx files
- Generate level meshes from w3x files with applying texture on it
- Navigation of units


## What are the next closing milestones?

- Create simple UI
- Add RTS AI
- Create harvesting functional
